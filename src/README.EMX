To build Lout using EMX+GCC on OS/2:

1. Untar the original Lout sources.

2. Copy Makefile.emx and patch-3.36-os2 into the lout-3.36 directory.

2. Run `patch < patch-3.36-os2' in the lout-3.36 directory (use GNU patch, not
   OS/2 patch).

3. Edit the BINDIR, LIBDIR, DOCDIR and MANDIR lines of Makefile.emx for your
   desired installation location. The other settings should probably be left
   alone, though you can eliminate the need for setting LOUTLIB in the
   environment if you set CLIBDIR appropriately at compile time.

   The BINDIR directory should already exist, and the parent directories of
   the LIBDIR, DOCDIR and MANDIR directories should already exist.

4. Run `make -f Makefile.emx install'. Lout is now ready to run.

5. You can also run `make -f Makefile.emx installdoc' to install the
   documentation, then use Lout itself to compile the documentation into
   PostScript format by running `lout all > out.ps' in each sub-directory
   of DOCDIR. You may need to run Lout several times to resolve all of the
   cross-references.
